    <p class="ruet">Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, commonly known as RUET (রুয়েট), is one of the
        leading PhD granting public <span class="versity">ruet</span> research universities in Bangladesh. It is one of
        the most prestigious public universities in the country that specialises in the field of engineering. Just like
        the other public engineering universities, the admission battle of RUET is considered to be the toughest one in
        the country as a student has to go through the selection process based in their grades and after getting

    <p class="ruet">RUET was founded in 1964 as Rajshahi Engineering College with a limited number of students. It was
        then changed to Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT) in 1986 and was finally renamed Rajshahi University of
        Engineering & Technology (RUET) in 2003 when it gained a university status. At present, more than 3500 students
        are pursuing their higher study in this green campus including under-graduate and post-graduate with over 250
        prominent faculty members in diverse field of expertise. The medium of instruction and necessary assessment of

    <section class="chemistry">Rutherford overturned Thomson's model in 1911 with his well-known gold foil experiment in
        which he demonstrated that the atom has a tiny and heavy nucleus. Rutherford designed an experiment to use the
        alpha particles emitted by a radioactive element as probes to the unseen world of atomic structure. If Thomson
        was correct, the beam would go straight through the gold foil. Most of the beams went through the foil, but a
        few were deflected.</section>
    <section class="chemistry">Rutherford presented his own physical model for subatomic structure, as an interpretation
        for the unexpected experimental results. In it, the atom is made up of a central charge (this is the modern
        atomic nucleus, though Rutherford did not use the term "nucleus" in his paper) surrounded by a cloud of
        (presumably) orbiting electrons. In this May 1911 paper, Rutherford only committed himself to a small central
        region of very high positive or negative charge in the atom.

    <div class="chemistry">For concreteness, consider the passage of a high speed α particle through an atom having a
        positive central charge N e, and surrounded by a compensating charge of N electrons.[2]


        From purely energetic considerations of how far particles of known speed would be able to penetrate toward a
        central charge of 100 e, Rutherford was able to calculate that the radius of his gold central charge would need
        to be less (how much less could not be told) than 3.4 × 10−14 meters. This was in a gold atom known to be 10−10
        meters or so in radius—a very surprising finding, as it implied a strong central charge less than 1/3000th of
        the diameter of the atom.

        The Rutherford model served to concentrate a great deal of the atom's charge and mass to a very small core, but
        didn't attribute any structure to the remaining electrons and remaining atomic mass. It did mention the atomic
        model of Hantaro Nagaoka, in which the electrons are arranged in one or more rings, with the specific
        metaphorical structure of the stable rings of Saturn. The plum pudding model of J. J. Thomson also had rings of
        orbiting electrons. Jean Baptiste Perrin claimed in his Nobel lecture[3] that he was the first one to suggest
        the model in his paper dated 1901.
